# Shortest Job First Scheduler
## Description:
### Given a positive integer n and the process id, arrival time and burst time of n processes, the program computes a Shortest Job First schedule of the processes
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n, denoting the number of processes
* The next n lines should contain three integers each denoting the process id, arrival time and burst time of the processes
## Output Format:
* The first few lines contain the schedule in tabular form
* The last three lines will contain the average waiting time, average response time and average turn around time of the schedule
## Time Complexity:
* O(n log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n)
