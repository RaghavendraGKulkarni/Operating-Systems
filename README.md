# Operating-Systems

## Description

- **Operating Systems** is a Code Library that contains a collection of solution programs to a variety of operating system problems

## How to use

Every problem contains a folder of its own. The structure of every folder is the same and is as described below:
- **Input.txt**: This file should contain the Input to the program. The file should be created with the input in it, before running the program. Refer to the README file in the folder of the problem for giving the input
- **Output.txt**: This file will contain the output of the program, after a successful execution. The file need not be necessarily created manually before running the program. The program will automatically create one, if it does not exist. Refer to the README file in the folder of the problem for interpreting the output
- **README.md**: This file contains the information regarding the problem like 
    * the Problem Name and Description, 
    * the Input format to be used by the user to give the input in the Input.txt file, 
    * the Output format used by the program to print the output in the Output.txt file, and 
    * the Time and Space Complexities of the algorithm used by the program as a function of the input size n
- **Solution.c**: This file contains the solution code for the problem in C language with suitable comments explaining every block of code
